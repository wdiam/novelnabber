# Web Novel to EPUB Converter

## Overview
This tool is designed as a proof of concept to demonstrate how to scrape web-based serialized novels and compile them into an EPUB format. It showcases web scraping, text processing, and EPUB creation techniques.

## Disclaimer
This project is intended for educational purposes only to explore data collection and eBook creation. The scraping of web novels might fall into a legal grey area depending on the content's licensing status, your jurisdiction, and the terms of service of the source website. **Users are responsible for ensuring that their use of this tool complies with all relevant laws and website terms.** This tool is not intended for the distribution of copyrighted material.

## Prerequisites
Before you can run this project, make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. Additionally, you'll need to install the necessary Python libraries which can be installed via the provided `requirements.txt` file.

### Installation
Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This `requirements.txt` file contains all the necessary Python packages to ensure that the environment is prepared for running the scripts successfully.

## Usage
To use this script, you need to provide the starting URL of the novel's first chapter, the output directory for the scraped chapters, and optionally the title and author of the book. A typical command would look like this:

```bash
python run.py "<start_url>" "<output_directory>" --title "<book_title>" --author "<author_name>"
```

### Example Invocation
Here is how you might typically call the script:

```bash
python run.py "https://example.com/novel/start-chapter" "./output" --title "Example Novel Title" --author "Author Name"
```

*Note:* Replace placeholder texts with actual values appropriate for the novel you are processing.

## Customization
You may need to make modifications to the scraping logic to adapt to different web novel formats or structures. This script provides a basic framework, but real-world applications will require adjustments.
